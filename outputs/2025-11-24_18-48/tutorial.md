*A blank page opens in the main area with 'Untitled' at the top, 'Add icon'/'Add cover' controls, and a faint "Type '/' for commands" hint—you're now on the new page.*

### Step 3

In the body of the new page beneath the title, type 'This is the initial content for my test page.' to add your first block of content.
