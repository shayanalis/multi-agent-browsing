# Create a Workflow in Asana: Build and Publish a Simple Rule

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to create and publish a basic workflow rule in an Asana project. We’ll navigate to the Workflow tab, add a trigger that runs when a task is added to the project, and publish the rule so it’s active for your team.

## What you’ll accomplish
- Open a project and access the Workflow tab
- Add a trigger for moving tasks automatically
- Publish the rule and confirm it’s active

---

## Step 1: Open your target project
- In the left sidebar, click the project named “Test project” to open it.
- You should see the project header with tabs like List, Board, Timeline, and Workflow at the top.

## Step 8: Confirm the workflow is active
- Verify that the rule appears in the workflow view and shows as published/active.
- From now on, when a task is added to this project, it will automatically follow the rule you just created.
